## About

This library provides a `StatusItemController` component that you can use to create menu bar apps, or apps with menu bar items in macOS.

This component is used in [Red Eye](https://www.hexedbits.com/redeye/) and [Lucifer](https://www.hexedbits.com/lucifer/).

## Usage

1. Subclass `StatusItemController`
1. Implement the following methods:
    1. `buildMenu() -> NSMenu`
    1. `leftClickAction()`
    1. `rightClickAction()`
1. Create an instance of your `StatusItemController` subclass in your `NSApplicationDelegate`.

## Requirements

- macOS 10.12+
- Swift 5.5+
- Xcode 13.0+
- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)

## Installation

### [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)

````ruby
pod 'StatusItemController', '~> 1.0.0'
````

### [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

Add `StatusItemController` to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/hexedbits/StatusItemController", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Alternatively, you can add the package [directly via Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app).

## Documentation

You can read the [documentation here](https://hexedbits.github.io/StatusItemController). Generated with [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy). Hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

## Notes on Testing

Unfortunately, `StatusItemController` cannot be tested directly. Attempting to create an `NSStatusItem` _outside_ of an app context throws an assert, which makes sense. Thus, in order to test `StatusItemController` it must be embedded in an app. Tests can be found in the Example App test suite. See [#15](https://github.com/hexedbits/StatusItemController/issues/15) for more details.
